# GitHub Copilot Workshop - Multilingual Documentation PRD

## Core Purpose & Success
- **Mission Statement**: Provide an accessible, interactive GitHub Copilot workshop documentation in both English and Spanish to serve a broader developer community.
- **Success Indicators**: Users can seamlessly switch between languages, all content renders correctly, and the interface adapts to language preferences.
- **Experience Qualities**: Inclusive, Professional, Accessible

## Project Classification & Approach
- **Complexity Level**: Light Application (multiple features with persistent state and internationalization)
- **Primary User Activity**: Consuming and Interacting with multilingual documentation

## Core Problem Analysis
Users who primarily speak Spanish need access to quality GitHub Copilot documentation but most technical resources are only available in English. This creates a barrier to learning and adoption.

## Essential Features

### Language Selection
- **What it does**: Allows users to switch between English and Spanish interface and content
- **Why it matters**: Makes the documentation accessible to Spanish-speaking developers
- **Success criteria**: Language changes persist across sessions and apply to all text content

### Multilingual Content System
- **What it does**: Renders all documentation content in the selected language
- **Why it matters**: Ensures consistent experience regardless of language preference
- **Success criteria**: All sections, navigation, and UI elements display in chosen language

### Persistent Language Preference
- **What it does**: Remembers user's language choice between sessions
- **Why it matters**: Reduces friction for returning users
- **Success criteria**: Language preference survives page refreshes and new sessions

## Design Direction

### Visual Tone & Identity
- **Emotional Response**: Welcoming and inclusive for developers of all language backgrounds
- **Design Personality**: Professional yet approachable, maintaining GitHub's clean aesthetic
- **Visual Metaphors**: Global connectivity through language accessibility
- **Simplicity Spectrum**: Clean and minimal to avoid overwhelming non-native speakers

### Color Strategy
- **Color Scheme Type**: Monochromatic with GitHub's signature blue
- **Primary Color**: GitHub blue (#0969da) for brand consistency
- **Secondary Colors**: Clean grays and whites for professional appearance
- **Accent Color**: Green for success states and positive interactions
- **Color Psychology**: Blue conveys trust and professionalism, important for technical documentation
- **Foreground/Background Pairings**: High contrast text for better readability across languages

### Typography System
- **Font Pairing Strategy**: Inter for UI (excellent multilingual support) and JetBrains Mono for code
- **Typographic Hierarchy**: Clear distinction between headers, body text, and code snippets
- **Font Personality**: Clean, readable, and technical without being intimidating
- **Readability Focus**: Generous line spacing and clear text sizing for comprehension
- **Which fonts**: Inter (UI text) and JetBrains Mono (code) - both with excellent Unicode support
- **Legibility Check**: Both fonts render clearly in Spanish including accented characters

### UI Elements & Component Selection
- **Language Selector**: Dropdown with flag indicators for visual recognition
- **Navigation**: Sidebar that updates text based on selected language
- **Search**: Multilingual search that works across both English and Spanish content
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-friendly interface that works on all devices

### Accessibility & Readability
- **Contrast Goal**: WCAG AA compliance for all text combinations
- **Language Indicators**: Clear visual cues for current language selection
- **Screen Reader Support**: Proper language attributes for assistive technology

## Implementation Considerations

### Translation Architecture
- Centralized translation system using TypeScript interfaces
- Fallback mechanism to English if Spanish translation missing
- Structured content format supporting both languages

### State Management
- Language preference stored in persistent KV storage
- Content switching without page refresh
- Search functionality across both language versions

### Content Structure
- All documentation sections available in both languages
- Consistent navigation structure regardless of language
- Code examples remain language-agnostic

## Technical Requirements

### Translation System
- TypeScript-based translation keys for type safety
- React hook for accessing translations and language state
- Efficient language switching without content flicker

### Persistent Storage
- Language preference saved using useKV hook
- Survives browser sessions and page refreshes
- Default to English for new users

### Search Integration
- Search functionality works across selected language content
- Results highlight matches in current language
- Search suggestions adapt to language context

## Edge Cases & Problem Scenarios

### Mixed Language Content
- Code examples remain in original language (usually English)
- External links may lead to English-only content
- Technical terms may not have direct translations

### Translation Completeness
- Fallback system when translations are incomplete
- Graceful handling of missing translation keys
- Clear indication of language availability

### Performance Considerations
- Minimal impact on load times despite larger content bundle
- Efficient rendering when switching languages
- Optimized search across multilingual content

## Success Metrics

### User Experience
- Language switching completes within 100ms
- All UI elements render correctly in both languages
- Search results are relevant in selected language

### Accessibility
- Screen readers properly announce language changes
- Text remains readable at all zoom levels
- High contrast maintained across all content

### Technical Performance
- No memory leaks during language switching
- Consistent search performance across languages
- Proper character encoding for accented characters

## Future Considerations

### Content Expansion
- Additional languages based on user demand
- More granular regional variations (e.g., Mexican vs. Argentinian Spanish)
- Community contribution system for translations

### Enhanced Features
- Language-specific code examples or cultural references
- Right-to-left language support for future expansion
- Translation quality improvements through user feedback

This multilingual implementation makes GitHub Copilot education accessible to Spanish-speaking developers while maintaining the high quality and professional presentation of the original documentation.
